Hogwarts Sorting Hat [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ecb1d3e0-5a3b-41e9-a780-1c9b3887ae21/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/davidpoole-sorting-hat/deploys)

This application is an exercise designed to not only only teach and practice code, but to have fun mimicking the sorting hat scenes involving the new students at Hogwarts academy in the Harry Potter movie series. New students (the user) will submit their name and be randomly sorted into one of the houses of the franchise. Upon expulsion, they will default to Voldemort's army.

Project Features
- Welcome landing page with navbar
- Click event buttons to advance the page to the next section with a user input form rendered on the DOM
- Form with a validation requirement requiring user input to advance and generate their user card and randomly selected house to the DOM
- Filter buttons (pertaining only to non-expelled students) to view only student cards of a specific house correlating to the same named filter button
- Expel button, which removes a student and re-renders them to Voldemort's army in a separate container with different styling to differentiate from the other non-expelled students
